# Density Based Traffic Control System

The system is a simple solution for a four way traffic on a point. For each road there are three LEDs - red, green and yellow. Simply after 7 secs (time can be increased, reduced for checking) the states of each road changes. So for the first 7 secs the Road 1 is open, then for 2 sec it changes states with road 2, and road 2 is Green for traffic and road 1 is red. This way the state of each road is changed.
Now for the second pard, each road in conneced with a sensor (IR is used to measure the traffic density). When one road has excessive traffic to cope with, the system keeps the Road Green until traffic clears. This way Density based traffic control system is designed.
